            Hi there! I’m a dedicated{" "}

              Frontend Developer and Creative Designer{" "}
            </span>
            with a passion for crafting user-friendly digital experiences and
            visually striking designs. My journey started in 2022 when I dived
            into the world of design using Canva, quickly advancing to master
            industry tools like{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop</span>.
            But my curiosity didn’t stop there; soon, I found myself drawn to
            the tech side, starting with{" "}
            <span className="font-bold">HTML and CSS</span>, and gradually
            growing into a skilled Frontend Developer.
          </p>

          <p className="text-secondary-0 font-poppins font-light w-[90%] mb-4">
            Today, I’m not just a creator—I’m a problem solver. I blend my
            expertise in frontend development with my eye for design, building
            accessible, responsive user interfaces and brand visuals that don’t
            just look good but work beautifully. Whether it’s a sleek web app or
            a captivating brand identity, I’m here to help businesses connect
            with their audiences in impactful ways.
